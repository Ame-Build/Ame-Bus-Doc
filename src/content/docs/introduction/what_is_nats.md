title: What is NATS
---

NATS is a simple, secure and performant messaging system for modern distributed systems. Compared to usual message system like Apache Kafka or rabbitmq, NATS provides more features out of box. It use its own algorithm to synchronize messages between nodes and service discovery, so you won't need Zookeeper or Consul.

We choose NATS because deployment is easy (than Apache Kafka), and usage is simple (than rabbitmq).

You can find more information about NATS on [NATS documentation](https://docs.nats.io/). Or, watch this video:
